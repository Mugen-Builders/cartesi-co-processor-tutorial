# Introduction

A coprocessor is a system that enables a smart contract to offload complex computations to an external platform and bring the processed results back onto the blockchain. The Cartesi Coprocessor is a cryptoeconomic mechanism that uses EigenLayer and restaked value to secure computations. Operators who misbehave or provide incorrect results are subject to slashing. Cartesi executes your computations in a Linux-compatible RISC-V virtual machine.
